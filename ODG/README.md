**Information**

	(O)n (D)eadly (G)round is a **server-side** challenge mod that turns all terrain blocks into explosive mines.

	Try to survive as long as possible (max. 360min) and kill as much ZÂ´s as possible! (1min = 1P / 1Zombie= 1P)

	You cannot mine terrain blocks, ie. Clay is only available through looting.
	
	Chrysanthemums, goldenrod and cotton can be broken down into plant fibers.

**Ranking**

	In order to participate in the official ranking system, the attempt must be streamed live and the toolbelt HUD must be activated.

	After starting the map, the console must be opened (F1) and scrolled up (Page Up) to confirm that you have not installed any further mods.

	If you pause, after stopping the game you have to display the resume screen from the world, from where the next stream has to start.

	If the challenge has been properly ended by your death or by reaching the maximum playing time (360min),
	
	open your character overview and take a screenshot of your stats, which you submit in Discord along with a link to your stream.

	Viewers who do not have a stream channel themselves can contact the organizer.
	
**Notes/Known Bugs**

	The game is very accurate when crossing blocks diagonally. It is recommended to avoid this or jump.

	The player preview comes a bit strange; but more funny than worst.
